### Phase 3: Final Integration and Release (Weeks 13-14)

1. **Final Testing**
   - [ ] Run all tests for all plugins
   - [ ] Verify integration between plugins (if any)
   - [ ] Perform manual testing of key functionality

2. **Documentation Review**
   - [ ] Review all documentation for accuracy and completeness
   - [ ] Update project-wide documentation with plugin-specific information
   - [ ] Create release notes for the new version

3. **Packaging and Distribution**
   - [ ] Create final package for distribution
   - [ ] Publish to PyPI
   - [ ] Create Docker images for containerized deployment
   - [ ] Provide installation scripts for common platforms

4. **Release**
   - [ ] Tag release in Git
   - [ ] Create GitHub release
   - [ ] Announce release to users
